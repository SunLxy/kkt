Basic Example for Electron
===

Use an example of [`electronjs`](https://github.com/electron).

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npx create-kkt my-app -e electron
cd my-app
npm install
```

**development**

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
npm run start
npm run app
```

**production**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
npm run app:build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
