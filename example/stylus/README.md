Basic Example for Stylus
---

React uses the server side rendering of the [stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/) based application.

[`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [`stylus`](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/) + [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/)

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npx create-kkt my-app -e stylus
cd my-app
npm install
```

## Development

**development**

Runs the project in development mode.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
