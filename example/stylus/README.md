Basic Example
---

React uses the server side rendering of the [stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/) based application.

[`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [`stylus`](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/) + [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/)

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-kkt-app my-app --example stylus
cd my-app
npm start
```

**development**

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
npm run start
```

**production**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Runs the compiled app in production.

```bash
npm run server
```
